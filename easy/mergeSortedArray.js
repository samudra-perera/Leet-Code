/* 
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

const merge = (nums1, m, nums2, n) => {
  // index of the last non zero number in nums1
  let first = m - 1;
  //index of the last number in nums2
  let second = n - 1;
  //length of array (same as nums1.length - 1)
  let i = m + n - 1;

  //While the second array still has elements do the following
  while (second >= 0) {
    //values to compare, comparing the largest values in each array
    let fVal = nums1[first];
    let sVal = nums2[second];

    //if fval if bigger than sval then set fval as the last element in the nums1 array since it is the largest among both arrays
    //Then decrement first and i
    //i is keeping track of the location to swap values starting from the end of nums1 array
    //Keep repeating
    if (fVal > sVal) {
      nums1[i] = fVal;
      i--;
      first--;
    } else {
      nums1[i] = sVal;
      i--;
      second--;
    }
  }
};
